Assignment:
The minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning is implemented in the AI class. Note, it is called "minmax" because of a typo, and I am too lazy to go back and fix it.

Bugs:
  - When the user is choosing their side and they input something that is not "1" or "2" on the keyboard it will cause the input stream to not work for whatever reason, so you have to restart the program. (CTRL+C to close program and ./project to run again)
